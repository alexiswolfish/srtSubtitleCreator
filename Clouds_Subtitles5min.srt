0:0:22,958 --> 0:0:26,291
With programming you can do
whatever you want. 

2
0:0:26,541 --> 0:0:28,166
And at some point, you� 

3
0:0:30,500 --> 0:0:34,125
I wouldn't say biblical, but it's like there's
nothing in the beginning 

4
0:0:34,166 --> 0:0:40,375
or just as you have in history it's just an empty space,
and you can start throwing things in there. 

5
0:0:43,458 --> 0:0:46,458
Well what I want to do,
I want to program like I can think.

6
0:0:46,500 --> 0:0:51,958
So like ten years ago I painted a lot,
and I want to get the same feeling with code. 

7
0:0:52,583 --> 0:0:55,500
There's so many things that you want to do
that you could do by hand, 

8
0:0:55,625 --> 0:0:59,708
and it would take you a long time, 
but if like, programming just increases  

9
0:0:59,750 --> 0:1:2,250
your capabilities, you know,
almost exponentially.

10
0:1:4,166 --> 0:1:7,458
I addicted myself. And I'm highly 
addicted to programming.

11
0:1:7,500 --> 0:1:13,708
 You can't stop me, sometimes I forget to eat. 
Sometimes I forget to sleep. 

12
0:1:13,916 --> 0:1:20,666
And� I don't know, can you turn a pickle back into 
a cucumber? Probably not. 

13
0:1:20,708 --> 0:1:25,125
 So I'm here for life. You've got me. 
 It's terminal. 

14
0:1:27,541 --> 0:1:31,750
This adding and taking away, 
that's kind of the design process now. 

15
0:1:31,833 --> 0:1:38,41
It's� I still feel in control, but I like to be surprised. 
I think that's the beauty of it. 

16
0:1:38,625 --> 0:1:44,0
The thing when a system goes beyond what you 
naturally understand it to do,

17
0:1:44,41 --> 0:1:47,291
and sometimes you have something that 
surprises you. 

18
0:1:47,833 --> 0:1:51,0
And I always look for that one moment, basically. 

19
0:1:56,833 --> 0:2:3,166
You get to a point in large visualizations where it's
actually too much data to look at as a flat image

20
0:2:3,375 --> 0:2:9,500
And you have to do some sort of zooming 
or, you know, flying through navigation 

21
0:2:9,541 --> 0:2:13,500
to get, I don't know, to focus on some small part of it 
because just, it's,

22
0:2:14,83 --> 0:2:17,708
I don't know, there's so many examples of
this like huge hairball of connections  

23
0:2:17,750 --> 0:2:19,458
and like, it means nothing at some point. 

24
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:26,500
And he is basically explaining how the database works,
and he says there's one point here

25
0:2:26,750 --> 0:2:30,625
And then you go around and there is another 
audio sample there and another one there 

26
0:2:30,916 --> 0:2:34,416
and because this is closer, this is the one which is matched.

27
0:2:35,125 --> 0:2:36,875
He explains everything like this. 

28
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:41,500
Interviewer: 'Is there an experience, a digital experience, 
that you desire to have?'

29
0:2:42,458 --> 0:2:49,458
Oh yes, teletransportation. Yeah. That's a, that's�
there are many things... 

30
0:2:51,458 --> 0:2:56,41
Yeah, there� there are many things, OK. 
Some I shouldn't talk about. 

31
0:2:56,83 --> 0:3:0,916
But yeah, teletransportation, it's because, you know 
there was a time when they would say 

32
0:3:1,0 --> 0:3:6,250
well with video conferences you won't need to meet,
but they don't work so well. 

33
0:3:6,875 --> 0:3:11,416
You still need to be with the people, to really  
discuss and work on projects. 

34
0:3:11,458 --> 0:3:19,625
You can do part of it by� video conferences, 
but it has it's limits, so it means I have to travel. 

35
0:3:19,875 --> 0:3:23,958
I am sick of traveling. I waste so much time� 

36
0:3:24,291 --> 0:3:29,875
� in the airport, and waiting for trains,
and I cannot work� so, I wish teletransportation

37
0:3:29,750 --> 0:3:35,208
Is it� is it possible? Is it going to be possible? 
I really want that. 

38
0:3:37,958 --> 0:3:43,333
You could start off with the point cloud of this
and then, I don't know at some point when I say 

39
0:3:43,333 --> 0:3:48,708
I don�t know, talking about water or physical systems
all the points could just flush 

40
0:3:48,833 --> 0:3:56,958
or turn into water or something like that just to 
illustrate the thing we've been talking about. 

41
0:3:57,250 --> 0:4:2,583
[quiet overlapping voices]  

42
0:4:3,208 --> 0:4:7,166
It's the thing that comes after a video camera. 
It's the thing that comes after a camcorder. 

43
0:4:7,750 --> 0:4:12,166
It's a Kinect with a digital camera on it, 
I guess there's a sound microphone. 

44
0:4:12,583 --> 0:4:14,375
And thre's this amazing, blinding light�

45
0:4:16,916 --> 0:4:21,541
Because this footage is rendered in a 3D environment 
and you have to look at it from some perspective

46
0:4:21,583 --> 0:4:24,541
You can browse anywhere in it
you can see just edges of it 

47
0:4:24,791 --> 0:4:28,416
or the camera angle can change, 
even though this camera's been completely static. 

48
0:4:28,541 --> 0:4:32,541
There's just a lot of room to play. 
It's an experimentation, you don't know what will work. 

49
0:4:32,625 --> 0:4:37,625
There's no cinematic language that has evolved yet,
so we're sort of at a point to define that. 

50
0:4:38,500 --> 0:4:43,375
In theory you could build the whole universe 
inside a computer. 

51
0:4:43,666 --> 0:4:46,625
You just don't have enough power
and then you'll never get there

52
0:4:46,875 --> 0:4:49,458
and it would be boring to build  
the same thing all over again. 

53
0:4:49,583 --> 0:4:54,125
But in theory, you could
and that's something I find kind of stunning. 

54
0:4:57,166 --> 0:5:0,83
