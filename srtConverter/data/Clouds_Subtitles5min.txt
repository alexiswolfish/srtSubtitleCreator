"		732	819	"I wouldn't say biblical, but it's like there's"	nothing in the beginning 	820	969	"or just as you have in history it's just an empty space,"	and you can start throwing things in there. 	1043	1115	"Well what I want to do,"	I want to program like I can think.	1116	1247	"So like ten years ago I painted a lot,"	and I want to get the same feeling with code. 	1262	1332	There's so many things that you want to do	"that you could do by hand, "	1335	1433	"and it would take you a long time, "	"but if like, programming just increases  "	1434	1494	"your capabilities, you know,"	almost exponentially.	1540	1619	I addicted myself. And I'm highly 	addicted to programming.	1620	1769	" You can't stop me, sometimes I forget to eat. "	Sometimes I forget to sleep. 	1774	1936	"And… I don't know, can you turn a pickle back into "	a cucumber? Probably not. 	1937	2043	 So I'm here for life. You've got me. 	 It's terminal. 	2101	2202	"This adding and taking away, "	that's kind of the design process now. 	2204	2353	"It's… I still feel in control, but I like to be surprised. "	I think that's the beauty of it. 	2367	2496	The thing when a system goes beyond what you 	"naturally understand it to do,"2497	2575	and sometimes you have something that 	surprises you. 2588	2664	"And I always look for that one moment, basically. "	2804	2956	You get to a point in large visualizations where it's	actually too much data to look at as a flat image2961	3108	And you have to do some sort of zooming 	"or, you know, flying through navigation "3109	3204	"to get, I don't know, to focus on some small part of it "	"because just, it's,"3218	3305	"I don't know, there's so many examples of"	this like huge hairball of connections  3306	3347	"and like, it means nothing at some point. "	3360	3516	"And he is basically explaining how the database works,"	and he says there's one point here3522	3615	And then you go around and there is another 	audio sample there and another one there 3622	3706	"and because this is closer, this is the one which is matched."	3723	3765	He explains everything like this. 	3768	3876	"Interviewer: 'Is there an experience, a digital experience, "	that you desire to have?'3899	4067	"Oh yes, teletransportation. Yeah. That's a, that's..."	there are many things... 4115	4225	"Yeah, there… there are many things, OK. "	Some I shouldn't talk about. 4226	4342	"But yeah, teletransportation, it's because, you know "	there was a time when they would say 4344	4470	"well with video conferences you won't need to meet,"	but they don't work so well. 4485	4594	"You still need to be with the people, to really  "	discuss and work on projects. 4595	4791	"You can do part of it by… video conferences, "	"but it has it's limits, so it means I have to travel. "4797	4895	I am sick of traveling. I waste so much time... 	4903	5037	"… in the airport, and waiting for trains,"	"and I cannot work… so, I wish teletransportation"5034	5165	Is it… is it possible? Is it going to be possible? 	I really want that. 5231	5360	You could start off with the point cloud of this	"and then, I don't know at some point when I say "5360	5489	"I don’t know, talking about water or physical systems"	all the points could just flush 5492	5687	or turn into water or something like that just to 	illustrate the thing we've been talking about. 5694	5822	[quiet overlapping voices]  	5837	5932	It's the thing that comes after a video camera. 	It's the thing that comes after a camcorder. 5946	6052	"It's a Kinect with a digital camera on it, "	I guess there's a sound microphone. 6062	6105	"And thre's this amazing, blinding light…"	6166	6277	Because this footage is rendered in a 3D environment 	and you have to look at it from some perspective6278	6349	You can browse anywhere in it	you can see just edges of it 6355	6442	"or the camera angle can change, "	even though this camera's been completely static. 6445	6541	There's just a lot of room to play. 	"It's an experimentation, you don't know what will work. "6543	6663	"There's no cinematic language that has evolved yet,"	so we're sort of at a point to define that. 6684	6801	In theory you could build the whole universe 	inside a computer. 6808	6879	You just don't have enough power	and then you'll never get there6885	6947	and it would be boring to build  	the same thing all over again. 6950	7059	"But in theory, you could"	and that's something I find kind of stunning. 7132	7202	[credits music]
